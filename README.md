# Processing Language Server
A language server for the Processing Language.  
This repository is a placeholder to remind me to start on this idea. Until a good language server is built, using Processing will be primarily restricted to the Processing IDE. While the IDE serves a great purpose, decoupling the language from the app will allow Processing developers to spend more time on language features and libraries.
